            "Star Restaurant" is a common name for eateries, and there may be several establishments with that name across different locations. Without a specific location provided, it's challenging to pinpoint a particular Star Restaurant. If you're looking for a Star Restaurant in a specific area, I recommend using online search engines, restaurant review websites, or local directories to find one in your desired location.
